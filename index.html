            One day after he saved the world from an alien invasion, Ciro has
            become a celebrity in nightclubs around the world. On his way to the
            set of a talk show, Ciro while he was drunk, witnesses a news
            broadcast announcing that aliens have returned ready to steal the
            beer of the earth. Unlike previous encounters, the aliens initially
            appear sober and not drunk at first, seem to pose no harm to the
            humans beer of Earth.

            Ciro's talk show appearance is canceled, because while he was
            talking he had passed out for too much beer ingested, but they taken
            profit to allow television stations to cover the alien invasion, and
            Ciro retires to the "Ciro's Cave'", his home where there are almost
            only beers. There, he receives a call from the president and General
            "Pepp A Sguess" of the Earth Defense Force (EDF). The president
            orders Ciro not to harm the invaders and adds that he is in
            diplomatic talks with the alien overlord.

            When Ciro is attacked by hostile aliens, he is forced to disobey the
            president's orders and fight his way through the alien hordes. While
            fighting through his Casin√≤ "no money, no beers", Ciro witnesses the
            aliens abducting women, including his ten girlfriends. Pepp A Sguess
            tells him that the women are being held in the Pleasure Hotel and
            that the aliens have a vendetta to settle with Ciro. He also warns
            him that the aliens are inseminating all the girls so more aliens
            can come through. Ciro travels to the Pleasure Hotel, using one of
            his wrecking ball to damage the building to gain access. Inside, he
            finds swarms of Octabrains and the missing women, who have been
            impregnated with alien spawn. Ciro's girlfriends die after bearing
            alien babies, infuriating Ciro. He finds the Alien Queen in control
            of the No money No Beers and kills her, but is drunk in the process
            and blacks out.

            After regaining consciousness, Ciro get drunk again and fights
            aliens through the Ciro Burger. He travels to Napoli in his strunz
            truck. After battling through the Vulcano, he finds his old friend
            Luca, mortally wounded. Luca tells Ciro that the reborn Ommemmerd
            Emperor is at the Vulcano and that the only way to shut down the
            portal is to completely destroy it. Before dying, he gives Ciro his
            demolition charges and wishes him luck. Ciro places the explosives
            and destroys the Vulcano, but the lava nearly drown him.

            Ciro is revived by an EDF soldier with a beer bottle and awakens to
            find the portal gone. The president, who was also at the dam, rages
            at Ciro for ruining his plans to work with the Ommemmerd Emperor.
            The president was actually intending to have the aliens kill Ciro so
            he could control the Earth. He has ordered a nuclear strike at the
            site of the Vulcano to wipe out the remaining aliens, intending to
            leave Ciro there to die. The Ommemmerd Emperor emerges and kills the
            president and his brainless security; he intended to kill the
            president after the deal. Ciro kills the Ommemmerd Emperor and then
            he announces his intent to run for President of Napoli.
